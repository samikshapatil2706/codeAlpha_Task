# ðŸŽ® CodeAlpha Task: Hangman Game

## Project Overview
**Hangman Game** is a simple and interactive command-line Python game designed especially for beginner programmers. The main objective is to guess a hidden word, one letter at a time, within a limited number of attempts, also known as **lives**.

---

##  Game Concept

A word is randomly selected from a list of family member names:
`"Ramdas"`, `"Roshani"`, `"Samiksha"`, `"Bhavini"`, `"Janhvi"`, `"Arohi"`, and `"Hardhika"`.

 The word is initially hidden and displayed as blank underscores (`_`), one for each letter.

 The player guesses **one letter per turn**:
- If the letter is **correct**, itâ€™s revealed in its correct position(s).
- If the letter is **wrong**, the player **loses a life**.

The game visually shows progress using **ASCII art**, stored in a separate Python file called `stages.py`, which represents the hangman figure depending on remaining lives.

The player **wins** if they guess all the letters correctly before lives run out.

ðŸ’€ The player **loses** if they use all their lives, and the correct word is revealed.

##  Extended Features

This version includes a more advanced structure using a `hangman_game()` function, which allows:

-  Multiple rounds of play using all words in the list
-  Tracking total wins and losses across rounds
-  Prompting the user if they wish to play again after each round

## Python Concepts Used

This project helps reinforce important Python programming concepts:

-  Loops (`while`, `for`)
-  Functions and modular code (`def`, `import`)
-  String and list operations
-  User input and output handling
-  Conditional statements (`if`, `else`)

---

##  Customization

You can easily extend or customize this game:

-  Add more words to the list
-  Modify the ASCII art in `stages.py`
-  Add features like difficulty levels or hints

---

##  Ideal For

-  Beginner Python programmers
-  Students learning control flow and logic
-  Anyone looking to build a fun and educational terminal-based game
