hangman_game<br>
This Python-based Hangman Game is a simple, interactive command-line game designed for beginner programmers. The objective of the game is to guess a hidden word, one letter at a time, within a limited number of attempts (lives). In this version, the words are names of family members such as "Ramdas", "Roshani", "Samiksha", "Bhavini", "Janhvi", "Arohi", and "Hardhika". When the game starts, a word is randomly selected from the list, and the player is shown blank spaces representing each letter. The player then inputs letter guesses one by one. If the guessed letter is correct, it is revealed in its correct position(s); otherwise, the player loses one life. The game visually displays progress using ASCII art stored in a separate module called stages.py, which represents the hangman figure based on the number of incorrect guesses. The player wins if all letters are guessed correctly before running out of lives; otherwise, they lose and the correct word is revealed.

This game also includes a more advanced structure with a hangman_game() function, which allows the player to play multiple rounds using all the words from the list. After each round, it keeps track of total wins and losses, and prompts the user if they would like to play again. The code uses basic Python features such as loops, functions, conditionals, string manipulation, list operations, and input/output handling, making it an excellent learning project. The game can be easily customized by adding more words or modifying the stages. It is a fun and educational project for anyone looking to build their programming skills with a practical and enjoyable application.
